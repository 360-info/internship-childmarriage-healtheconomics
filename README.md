# ETC5543 - Business Analytics Creative Activity : Data Analysis Revolutinizing Journalism

ETC5543 Report is a brief summary of the analysis we have conducted at 360info organisation. It contains draft and final analysis for the two topics assigned during our internship. It also includes exploratory data analysis for knowledge purposes. 

Topic 1: Our initial task was researching datasets related to child marriage, particularly during Covid-19. Followed by data wrangling for tidying data and combining datasets for the final visualization. The above visualisations were the initial drafts for the editorâ€™s reference and have played a crucial role in arriving at the final visualisation.
In order to understand the contrast between the child marriage rate across the globe and the legal policy existing in each country, we wanted to create one visualisation which could display both. 

Topic 2: The aim was to observe the trend of HDI and Happiness Score(Life Ladder Score) over the past years. While HDI is more quantitative and defined and Happiness Score is more subjective based on well-being, the difference in trends of both the scores speaks volumes. Unlike the first topic, the idea behind this visualisation was conceived from the start once the datasets had been shortlisted. The countries in this visualisation were shortlisted based on the unique trend observed amongst all the countries.

## Reproduce the analysis

### ðŸ’¨ Quickstart: use the dev container

This project comes with a ready-to-use [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that includes everything you need to reproduce the analysis (or do a similar one of your own!), including [R](https://r-project.org) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

1. [Launch this project in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=[report_codespaces_id])
2. If you have Docker installed, you can build and run the container locally:
  - Download or clone the project
  - Open it in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - Run the **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container** command

Once the container has launched (it might take a few minutes to set up the first time), you can run the analysis scripts with:

```sh
quarto render
```

Or look for the `.qmd` files to modify the analysis.

### Manual setup

To setup a development environment manually, 

You'll need to:
- [Download and install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started)
- [Download the install R](https://www.r-project.org)
- Satisfy the R package dependencies. In R:
  * Install the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) package with `install.packages("renv")`,
  * Then run `renv::restore()` to install the R package dependencies.
  * (For problems satisfying R package dependencies, refer to [Quarto's documentation on virtual environments](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).)

Now, render the `.qmd` files to the `/out` directory with:

```sh
quarto render
```
